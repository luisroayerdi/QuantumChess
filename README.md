Quantum 
Chess 
Rules 

Same as classical chess in terms of setup of pieces, pieces movement, special rules and winning rules, with the following additions.

Superposition.

In quantum chess pieces follow the same movement restriction as classical chess but with the added possibility; not obligation; of choosing two out of their possible movements instead of one, which would put the piece in a superposition state. 

Superposition can not be performed when a piece only has one possible movement, this includes encastling.

In the following example we have a white queen in e4, moving to both e5 and e2, but now in a superposition state.

Pieces in superposition.
Pieces in superposition don't have the same properties as a piece in a regular state, in other words a piece under superposition is not a duplicate of its regular counterpart. 

In order for a piece under superposition to attack or be attacked, the piece has to go through the “observer effect”. With the exception of the attack resulting in a checkmate (this would be covered in following pages).

Observer effect.
When a piece in superposition state decides to attack or it's being attacked by another piece, it has to go through the observer effect. This would force the piece to choose between either one of the two squares which its superposition corresponds to. This choice is completely random and it has a ½ probability of occurring. 

Defensive superposition.
In the following example black rock in e3 attacks queen e5.

Based on the observer effect there's a ½ chance of any of the two following outcomes:
The queen's actual position is c2, therefore the rook to the desire square and ends the superposition of the queen 
The queen's actual position is e5, therefore the rook successfully kills both of the superpositions

Offensive Superposition.
If a player desires to move one of its pieces in a superposition state, it would have the ability to choose one movement per superposition, so that when the piece goes through the observer effect the player has selected a movement for both possible positions of the piece.

Superposition Checkmate exception.
Although pieces in a superposition state have to go through “The observer effect” to attack other pieces, this is not true when the attack leads to a checkmate. 

A player can achieve checkmate, check or stalemate by attacking with pieces in superposition without forcing a piece out of the quantum state, this is called “Quantum Checkmate” “Quantum check” and “Quantum stalemate respectively”.

In the following example king e3 is being attacked by a superposition-queen  in e5 and c2, this leads to a “Quantum Checkmate” and the victory of the white player.
